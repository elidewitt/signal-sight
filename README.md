# signal-sight
High school senior engineering project (PLTW)

Problem Statement: Environmental factors such as heavy snow or direct sunlight impact the ability of a driver, especially those who are color blind to interpret the color of traffic signals correctly.

Our solution was an application that relays traffic light status to the driver visually and verbally. We tried asking the DOT if we could somehow get access to traffic light data and he said no for security reasons :( so we created databases with example data for testing.
